## Installation
First you have to install the dependencys with the following command:
```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you get this error: 
```error
ImportError: Unable to import required dependencies: numpy
```
Try this: 
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
```
After that you are ready to execute with: 
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 app.py <Your cookie>
```
### Finding your cookie
The appication needs your login cookie from the [LIVEYOURLIFE](https://www.lyl.gg) website because the market data is only available as a logged in user. 

- Step 1: Go to the website and log in
- Step 2: Press F12
- Step 3: Go to "Web-Storage"
- Step 4: Click on "Cookies" then on "https://www.lyl.gg/"
- Step 5: Copy the value of the entry "wsc_267ea4_cookieHash"

Voil√† there you have your cookie üç™

## Setup 
I personally run the dashboard on my raspberry pi. But running it locally for a few hours should also be no problem.
